Siófok is one of the most important towns on the southern shore of Lake Balaton. The railway station is located not far from the Sió Canal, with the station building positioned on the side facing away from the lake. It is a key junction station, with trains heading in three directions: towards Budapest, Nagykanizsa, and Kaposvár. InterCity trains running between Budapest and Nagykanizsa also stop here.

The original station building was opened in 1863, just two years after the Buda–Nagykanizsa railway line was completed. It was built as a single-storey structure following the standard design of the Southern Railway.

The current station building is no longer the original, but it is also very old — it was probably constructed in the early 1900s. A postcard from 1904 already shows this building with the inscription “New Station.”

The station building was restored to its original appearance during renovations carried out in 1987.
