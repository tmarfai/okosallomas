Zamaardee railway station is an important transport point on the southern shore of Lake Balaton,
especially during the summer season when festivals, concerts,
and beach programs attract a large number of passengers. 
The station is located close to the town centre, so the beach, the main street shops, 
and cultural venues are easy to reach on foot. Although it is not a major junction, 
express and InterCity trains that operate along the southern shore of Lake Balaton also stop here, 
particularly during major events.

The station building is a simple yet charming structure in the classic Balaton style, 
and it has undergone several renovations over the years. 
Modern digital displays and covered platforms serve passengers, 
and during summer weekends, the station becomes a lively meeting place for festival visitors, 
beachgoers, and holidaymakers. Zamaardee station is no longer just a transport stop, 
but a symbolic gateway to the Balaton experience.
