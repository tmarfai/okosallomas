Abalee-get railway station is a train station located in the village of Abalee-get, 
in Baranha County, operated by the Hungarian State Railways. 
The station is situated on the Pécs–Baatasaik branch line, 
approximately fifteen kilometers west of Pécs. 
It was opened in the first half of the twentieth century, 
during a period when tourism in the area — especially due to the cave 
and the lake — significantly increased.

The station building is small and functions as a single-track stop with a simple 
design that blends well with its surroundings. 
Train traffic is sparse, but the station plays an important role for hikers and tourists 
who use it to access the Abalee-get Cave and the Bat Museum. 
The stop is still in operation today, and although passenger numbers are modest, 
its importance has not diminished thanks to the surrounding protected natural area.
