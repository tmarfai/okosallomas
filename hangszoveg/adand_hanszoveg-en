Ádánd railway station is located on Line 35, which connects Kaposhvár and Sheeofok, in Shomodj County. It’s a small stop primarily serving local passenger trains, mostly heading toward Sheeofok, Tab, and Kaposhvár. The station itself is pretty simple, with just one track and a single platform, but it plays an important role in connecting the village. There’s no ticket office anymore, but you can easily get your ticket from a machine or buy it online. Thanks to its proximity to Lake Balaton and the regional importance of the railway line, Ádánd station still plays an active part in both local and regional travel.
