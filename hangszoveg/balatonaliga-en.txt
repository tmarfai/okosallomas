Balatonaliga railway station is located in Shomodj County, operated by the Hungarian State Railways. Here, the railway track lies significantly higher than the lake’s water level and begins to descend all the way down.
Administratively, Balatonaliga belongs to Balatonvilágosh.
The station building is not on the lakeside; the area in that direction is bordered by a forest. The station has three tracks and is situated on a curve, with the passing track being the second one.
The easiest way to reach the lakeside from the station is on foot. At the Sheeofok end of the station, a pedestrian crossing and stairs lead down to the shore, where there is a beach.
