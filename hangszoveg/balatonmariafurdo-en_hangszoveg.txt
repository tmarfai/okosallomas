The village is connected to the wider region via the Budapest–Murakeresztúr railway line. The local station is located on the western edge of the settlement, near the intersection with Road 7119. The original station building was a simpler structure, which was later rebuilt following the architectural style of Ferenc Pfaff.

In the past decade, the station has undergone significant upgrades. In 2023, it was fully renovated and now features a modern and accessible station building. With its tastefully restored waiting room, ticket office, restrooms, and showers, the station now offers a much higher standard of service to passengers.
