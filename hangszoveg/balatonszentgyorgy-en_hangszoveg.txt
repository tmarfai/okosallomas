Balatonsendyurj station serves as a junction for four railway lines, 
making it one of the busier stations in the region. 
It is equipped with light signals and motor-operated switches, 
with both ends featuring level crossings protected by light and half-barriers. 
Unlike many other stations, 
the first track is suitable for train arrivals and is accompanied by a high platform. 
There is also a high platform between the second and third tracks, 
and a fence separates the first and second tracks. 
Additionally, a siding branches off the main line and is electrified all the way to the facility gate.

The station has undergone recent reconstruction. 
The third track now ends in a stub track to the right of the exit, 
from where local passenger trains depart.  
A commemorative plaque has been mounted on the station building to mark 
the 140th anniversary of the railway lineâ€™s foundation.
