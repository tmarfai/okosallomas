Barcs railway station is located in the southern part of Somogy County, on the eastern side of the town, not far from the Drava River. The station is part of the Gyékényes–Pécs railway line and serves only domestic passenger trains – primarily in the directions of Kaposvár, Szigetvár, and Pécs.

While the station building previously housed a ticket office, today passengers typically use ticket machines or purchase tickets online. The platforms are covered, and the waiting room is operational, allowing for a comfortable start to the journey.

Barcs' public transport network and the town’s main roads are connected to the station, making it a daily transport hub for commuters, students, and those transferring to other routes.

Although there is currently no direct railway connection to neighboring Croatia, Barcs railway station remains an important part of the Southern Transdanubian railway network and the everyday life of local residents.
