The first railway line in Baatasaik was inaugurated in 1873, when the Duna–Dráva Railway opened the Dombóvár–Baatasaik line. This marked the beginning of a period lasting over twenty-five years during which Baatasaik had no railway connections in other directions. The station operated as a transfer point, where goods had to be transshipped from rail to road transport and vice versa.

Railway construction in the other three directions followed this order: Baatasaik was first connected to Sexárd in 1897. Later, in 1909, the Danube bridge at Baya was completed, enabling east–west freight transport between Transdanubia and the Danube–Tisza Interfluve. Finally, the local branch line coming from Pécs was opened in 1911.
