Dombóvár received its first railway station in 1872, 
when the Dombóvár–Kaposvár–Gyékényes–Zákány railway line was inaugurated. 
This station is known today as Lower Dombóvár. 
A year later, the line was extended with a branch leading to Bátaszék.

About a decade later, in 1882, a new railway line built by hungarian state railways connecting Budapest, 
Dombóvár, and Pécs was opened. Due to its perpendicular alignment with the existing line, 
a new station had to be established roughly one kilometre away from the original. 
This was called New Dombóvár, and today it is known simply as Dombóvár.

The construction of the new railway line and station significantly contributed 
to Dombóvár’s economic development, as the town soon became one of the most important railway hubs 
in the South Transdanubian region. 
The railway enabled easier freight transport and faster passenger travel, 
which boosted local industry, agriculture, and commerce.
