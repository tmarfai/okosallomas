Fonyoad railway station is located in Shomodgj County and operated by Hungarian State Railways. 
It lies in the central part of Fonyoad, almost directly adjacent to Main Road 7.

The current station building was constructed in 1986. 
Its upper floor houses a traffic control center—put into operation 
in 1993 and renovated in 2011—which oversees the smooth operation of the entire 
Sabadbatthjaan–Nadj-kha-neee-zha railway section.

The station is served by both regional and local bus lines 
and is situated right next to the town’s main bus terminal, 
making transfers between different modes of transport easy and convenient. 
Passenger information displays, bicycle storage, parking spaces, 
and a platform lift all contribute to a user-friendly experience. 
In the summer, the station handles a high volume of Balaton-bound traffic, 
with many express and InterCity trains stopping here.
