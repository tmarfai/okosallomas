The county seat was reached by rail in 1872, when the Duna-Dráva Railway opened 
the Zaikainh–Shomodgjsob–Kaposhvár–Dombóvár line. A year later, 
the line was extended from Dombóvár to Baatasaik, 
which meant rail service arrived here ten years before the construction of the Budapest–Pécs main line. 
In the years that followed, 
four branch lines were built from Kaposhvár: in 1894 the Kaposhvár–Felshomotsholaad line, 
which was extended to Sheeofok in 1906; in 1896 the Kaposhvár–Fonyoad line; 
in 1900 the Kaposhvár–See get var line; and in 1905 the Kaposhvár–Kozaipregoots line. 
The last two were closed at the end of the 1970s.

The station building that still stands today was built between 
1898 and 1899 and was designed by the famous architect Ferenc Pfaff. 
This station design can be considered a type plan, 
as the same successful design was also used for the stations at Vershets and Satmaarnaimathee.
