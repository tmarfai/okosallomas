The county seat was reached by rail in 1872, when the Duna-Dráva Railway opened the Zákány–Somogyszob–Kaposvár–Dombóvár line. A year later, the line was extended from Dombóvár to Bátaszék, which meant rail service arrived here ten years before the construction of the Budapest–Pécs main line. In the years that followed, four branch lines were built from Kaposvár: in 1894 the Kaposvár–Felsőmocsolád line, which was extended to Siófok in 1906; in 1896 the Kaposvár–Fonyód line; in 1900 the Kaposvár–Szigetvár line; and in 1905 the Kaposvár–Középrigóc line. The last two were closed at the end of the 1970s.

The station building that still stands today was built between 1898 and 1899 and was designed by the famous architect Ferenc Pfaff. This station design can be considered a type plan, as the same successful design was also used for the stations at Vršac and Satu Mare.
