Keszuhheedegkoot - Gyönk railway station is located in the hilly region of Tolna County and serves as a shared stop for the two settlements, Keszuhheedegkoot and Gyönk. The station lies along railway line number 40, which provides an important connection between the towns of Southern Transdanubia.

The construction of the railway line dates back to the late 19th century, originally intended for transporting agricultural goods and ensuring rural transport. Today, many trains pass through the stop, including the Matchek InterCity running between Budapest and Pécs.
