Keszuhheedegkoot - Gyönk railway station is located in the gently rolling landscape of Tolna County and serves the nearby villages of Keszuhheedegkoot and Gyönk. It lies along the Dombóvár–Baatasaik railway line, which plays an important role in connecting towns and villages across Southern Transdanubia.

The line was built in the late 19th century, originally to transport agricultural goods and support local travel. Today, the station is served by regional trains a few times a day. While traffic is modest, the stop still provides valuable transport access for local residents and visitors alike.
