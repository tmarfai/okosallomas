Mohács railway station is located in the eastern part of the town, close to the Danube,
and serves as an important transport hub in the region. 
The station is part of the Pécs–Villány–Mohács railway line, 
which has served both passengers and freight traffic in the area for decades.

The building is simple and functional in design, 
reflecting the atmosphere of earlier railway architecture. 
The station primarily handles regional trains, 
but its significance goes beyond transport. 
It also plays a role in local history, as the town and its surroundings have a rich historical heritage.

From the station, it is easy to reach the town centre, 
the Danube riverbank, and several major sights. 
The railway is an ideal choice for visitors coming to Mohács
in search of cultural experiences or natural beauty.
