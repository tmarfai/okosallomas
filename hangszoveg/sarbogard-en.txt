Sharbogard railway station is located in the town of Sharbogard, Fahair County, and is operated by the Hungarian State Railways.
The station building was the first post-war structure built by the Hungarian State Railways, designed by architect Ferenc Kajdi and completed in 1947. Its form and windows reflect a Bauhaus style — the finely segmented windows often form continuous bands of glass.
A particularly striking feature is the curved section and its windows on the street-facing façade.
Breaking from earlier traditions, the building is flat and sprawling, composed of many smaller structural units arranged in a complex system.
Its architectural concept follows the direction seen in pre World War II buildings by architects such as Nándor Heimann and yeahnou Kamaráshy.
