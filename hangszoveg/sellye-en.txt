Shayyeh railway station is located in Baranha County, and is operated by the Hungarian State Railways.
In 1903, it was still referred to as Baranha-Shayyeh station, but later timetables already used the current name. It is currently the terminus of the Santloorenz–Shayyeh railway line, ever since traffic was discontinued on the section leading to Zaláta.
The station features a well-preserved second-class station building, built according to the typical suburban railway designs of the era. It is considered the best-maintained railway structure along the entire line.
Since 2000, a marble plaque on the wall of the station building – similar to the one in Santloorenz – commemorates the founding of the Shayyeh railway line in 1895.
Several smaller structures in the station’s surroundings – such as guardhouses, a water house, and a warehouse – also preserve their 19th-century appearance.
