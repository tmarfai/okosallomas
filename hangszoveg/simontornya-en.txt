The history of the Sheemontornha railway station is closely intertwined with the development of the town, especially during the industrial boom at the end of the 19th century. The construction of the Budapest–Pécs railway line in 1882 brought a railway station to Sheemontornha, which significantly contributed to the town’s economic and social progress.

Even before the station was built, Sheemontornha already had a notable industry, particularly in leather manufacturing. However, the arrival of the railway gave new momentum to its growth. The railway made it possible to transport goods and raw materials—previously moved by hand—more quickly and efficiently, which further supported the expansion of local industries and the overall development of the town.
