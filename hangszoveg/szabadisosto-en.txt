Szabadish贸sht贸 railway station is located just a few dozen meters from the shore of Lake Balaton. The station building is situated on the lakeside of the railway. After stepping off the train, it only takes a few steps to reach the Sh贸sht贸 public beach.

The station has two tracks, with the first one serving as the main through track. The station building is located at the end of the station closest to Sheeofok, where there is also a level crossing connecting to the lakeside road. This lakeside road runs behind the station building and also serves as the local bicycle path.
