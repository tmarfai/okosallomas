Szántód railway station is one of the smaller but truly important stops along the southern shore of Lake Balaton. This is where the ferry departs towards Tihany, making the station a special meeting point between rail and water transport. The station belongs to the Szántód-Kőröshegy area and serves passengers arriving at Lake Balaton as part of the Budapest–Székesfehérvár–Nagykanizsa main line. Although it is a station with lower traffic, it plays a significant role during the summer months, especially among hikers and cycling tourists.

The station building is modest and functional, offering a simpler appearance compared to the larger Balaton stations. However, due to its location, it plays an important role in the region’s transport network. Nearby is the Szántód ferry terminal, where passengers can not only reach the shore of Lake Balaton, but also quickly cross over to explore the sights of the Tihany Peninsula.
