The railway line leading into the town was built in two phases. 
The first section came from Rétszilas and reached the town in 1883. 
The continuation towards Bátaszék was completed in 1897. 
During the years between these phases, Bátaszék functioned as a transfer station 
where goods arriving by rail were loaded onto road vehicles, or vice versa.

The current station building was constructed in 1940. 
It reflects an architectural style inspired by traditional folk design. 
The station is also an official stamping point 
for the South Transdanubian and Great Plain Blue Trail hiking routes.
